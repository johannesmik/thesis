## tof-camera.blend

This file is the first try to rebuild Kinect One characteristics in Blender... 

After rendering, 4 images are put into the /tmp/test directory: Color, IR, Depth, and Normal image.

Features:

    - Realistic shading of the color image and ir image,
    - Replicated shadowing artifacts in the depth image,
    - 'Shaky' camera movements when rotating around the main object.
